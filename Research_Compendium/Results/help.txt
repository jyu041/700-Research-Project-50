ASL contains only ASL signs and evaluation.
eval_results_CNN contains evaluation from only MobileNetV2 classifier
eval_results_two_stage contains evaluation from YOLO + MobileNetV2
eval_tf contains is tensorflow model and pytorch (MobileNetV2 and YOLO) respectively
eval_tflite contains tensorflow lite converted YOLO and MobileNetV2

ASL+BSL follows the same structure as ASL

LSA64 contains evaluation result for dynamic hand signs
eval_pytorch contains the model evaluation as the pytorch model
eval_tflite contains the model evaluation as converted tflite model

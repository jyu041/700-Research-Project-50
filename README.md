# Project #50: 
## Sign Language Recognition on a Single Board Computer
In this project, we will develop and evaluate a system designed to recognise as many hand signs as possible in real-time and as accurately as possible. Our goal is to determine what is practically possible on a lightweight system such as a Raspberry Pi.

# Project #50: 
## [Sign Language Recognition on a Single Board Computer](https://part4project.foe.auckland.ac.nz/home/project/detail/5580/)
In this project, we will develop and evaluate a system designed to recognise as many hand signs as possible in real-time and as accurately as possible. Our goal is to determine what is practically possible on a lightweight system such as a Raspberry Pi.

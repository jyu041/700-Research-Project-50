# Image Datasets:
## [ASL Alphabet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet)
Kaggle Usability score: 8.75

License: [GPL 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)
### Content:
The training data set contains 87,000 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters A-Z and 3 classes for SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING.
These 3 classes are very helpful in real-time applications, and classification.
The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real-world test images.

### Content:
The Dataset has been broadly classified into Training and Testing Data. Training Data has been classified and segregated into 29 classes, of which 26 alphabets A-Z and 3 other classes of SPACE, DELETE, NOTHING. The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real-world test images.

## [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)
Kaggle Usability score: 7.65

### Content:
The dataset format is patterned to match closely with the classic MNIST. Each training and test case represents a label (0-25) as a one-to-one map for each alphabetic letter A-Z (and no cases for 9=J or 25=Z because of gesture motions). The training data (27,455 cases) and test data (7172 cases) are approximately half the size of the standard MNIST but otherwise similar with a header row of label, pixel1,pixel2â€¦.pixel784 which represent a single 28x28 pixel image with grayscale values between 0-255. The original hand gesture image data represented multiple users repeating the gesture against different backgrounds. The Sign Language MNIST data came from greatly extending the small number (1704) of the color images included as not cropped around the hand region of interest. To create new data, an image pipeline was used based on ImageMagick and included cropping to hands-only, gray-scaling, resizing, and then creating at least 50+ variations to enlarge the quantity. The modification and expansion strategy was filters ('Mitchell', 'Robidoux', 'Catrom', 'Spline', 'Hermite'), along with 5% random pixelation, +/- 15% brightness/contrast, and finally 3 degrees rotation. Because of the tiny size of the images, these modifications effectively alter the resolution and class separation in interesting, controllable ways.

## [Hand Signs | ASL Hand Sign Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeyasrisenthil/hand-signs-asl-hand-sign-data)
Kaggle Usability score: 8.75

License: [Database: Open Database, Contents: Da](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1-0/)
### Content:
The dataset contains images of hand gestures of the letters A-Z and the numbers 0-9, captured in controlled lighting conditions. It is useful for developing computer vision models and machine learning algorithms for sign language recognition.

# Video Datasets:
## [WLASL (World Level American Sign Language) Video](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/risangbaskoro/wlasl-processed)
Kaggle Usability score: 9.38

License: [Computational Use of Data Agreement (C-UDA)](https://github.com/microsoft/Computational-Use-of-Data-Agreement/tree/v1.0)
### Content:
WLASL is the largest video dataset for Word-Level American Sign Language (ASL) recognition, which features 2,000 common different words in ASL. We hope WLASL will facilitate the research in sign language understanding and eventually benefit the communication between deaf and hearing communities.

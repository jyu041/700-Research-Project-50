# Ideas for system

OpenCV (for camera capture/preprocessing)

TensorFlow Lite (for lightweight inference)

MediaPipe (for possible hand landmark detection)

Custom built Convolutional Neural Network - CNN

We can also reference Tony's [HandSeals](https://github.com/H-qitai/HandSeals) project for the code base.
